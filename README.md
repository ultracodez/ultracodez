# Hi there 👋
I'm ultracodez.

## About me

I'm an experienced self taught developer in multiple languages, but mainly strongly-typed (JavaScript --> *yuck*). I use C#, C++ and TypeScript in most of my applications. 

### What I'm working on 🔎

I love making tools with clean, modern UIs (yes, I'm a self-declared minimalist). My favorite applications to make are productivity tools, because both I and other people can use them!

What I'm working on:

 - *[profyle.net](https://profyle.net/)* - It doesn't look like much yet, but I'm working to turn it into a fully-fledged developer directory.
 - *[Eniv](https://eniv.vercel.app/)* - A 1-5 second meme website, the concept was mentioned by popular youtuber
 - Some other miscellaneous projects



### Why *ultracodez*?
For as long as I played video games, my gamertag always started with ultra. It sounded like a cool name, yet it never stuck. In in-game chat, I was always referred to as *Ultra*. Eventually, the name stuck, and as I turned from a wannabe-developer to a sleek fast-typing pro, my name evolved to my current username, **ultracodez**. 

### 🧭 Availability: 

I'm actively looking for project & collabs to work on. Feel free to send me a message!
